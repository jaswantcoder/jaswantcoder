### Hi there, I'm Jaswant ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at National Institute of Technology Meghalaya. I love programming and learning, so I have a couple of repositories with experiments and material that I've used in my learning process.

### What I'm up to right now

- Doing some [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/jaswantcoder/) problems. Currently, I'm trying to solve one problem per day. [Repository](https://github.com/jaswantcoder/leetcode).
- Currently reading [Algorithms in a Nutshell](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/algorithms-in-a/9780596516246/) by George Heineman, Gary Pollice and Stanley Selkow.
- Currently reading The C Programming Language by Brian Kerninghan and Dennis Ritchie.
